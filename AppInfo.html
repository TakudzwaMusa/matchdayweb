      <h2 class="section-heading">App Overview</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        Matchday Superfan is a social media platform designed to bring home-viewing fans (SuperFans) as close as possible to the real in-stadium experience. Whether you’re cheering from your couch or from the stands, the app makes sure you feel connected, engaged, and part of the action.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text mt-4">
        For SuperFans at home, it’s about contributing to your team’s journey from anywhere in the world, while still enjoying the thrill and energy of the stadium. For fans attending live matches, it’s about enhancing that stadium experience with premium content features – creating a virtual stadium that others can join.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-subheading mt-6">How It Works (App Model)</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>Stadium-attending fans can scan their matchday tickets to create and host a Channel called “Fandom.” Think of it like being the admin of a chat group – only you can start the channel, but anyone can join.</li>
        <li>Each host can create only one channel per match, while home fans can follow unlimited channels.</li>
        <li>Matches will only appear on the app once a match has been created by the Event Host (Club/Event organizer).</li>
        <li>Multiple sporting codes are supported. Fans only receive notifications from the channels they follow.</li>
      </ul>
